# Configuration Guide

netflow-api is configured using a TOML config file that is by default located in `etc/netflow-api/netflow-api.conf`.
An example configuration file is located in etc/ which can help you get started.

#### Main netflow-api config

\[netflow-api\]
* PolicyFilePath - Location of [OpenStack policy file](https://docs.OpenStack.org/security-guide/identity/policies.html) - policy.json file for which roles are required to access audit events. 
Example located in `etc/policy.json`

#### ElasticSearch configuration
Any data served by netflow-api requires an underlying ElasticSearch installation to act as the Datastore.

\[ElasticSearch\]
* url - Url for ElasticSearch

#### Integration for OpenStack Keystone
\[keystone\] 
* auth_url - Location of v3 keystone identity - ex. https://keystone.example.com/v3
* username - OpenStack *service* user to authenticate and authorize clients.
* password 
* user_domain_name

* token_cache_time - In order to improve responsiveness and protect Keystone from too much load, netflow-api will
re-check authorizations for users by default every 15 minutes (900 seconds).
